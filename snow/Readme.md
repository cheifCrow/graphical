#Snow

Project snow is simply rendering multicolored snow(rectangles) on a black background. The snow falls, and moves to the left and right. Once the snow exits the screen, the snow is removed from memory. The snow flakes exis as linked list members allowing for easy creation, and arbitrary deletion.

For now a simple 2D SDL renderer is utilized, however I will be working on a fully 3D opengl implementation. Maybe I'll even add music later.
