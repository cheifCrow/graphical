#Snow

A makefile has been provided and was tested with OS X and Linux.

Required libraries: SDL2

Snow is simply rendering multicolored snow(rectangles) on a black background. The snow falls, and moves to the left and right. Once the snow exits the screen, the snow is removed from memory. The snow flakes exist as linked list members allowing for easy creation, and arbitrary deletion.
